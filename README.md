# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis


**Project Overview**

This project analyzes Instacart’s open-source grocery shopping data to uncover customer purchasing behaviors and support targeted marketing strategies. Using Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn), I conducted exploratory analysis across millions of grocery orders to identify patterns in customer habits, peak shopping times, popular product categories, and demographic purchasing trends. The insights generated help Instacart optimize marketing campaigns, tailor promotions to specific customer groups, and better understand how shoppers behave across different regions and age groups.

🎯**Key Questions**

- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- At what times do customers spend the most money?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
- Is there a connection between age and income?
- Who are Instacart's most valueable customers?
- How does customer's income vary across different US regions, and what insights can Instacart use to tailor marketing and product strategies?
